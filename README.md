This program is a remake of the NASA TLX program for identifying workload. The program consists of four screens and creates a csv file at the end in the same folder location as the program. The first asks for a file id, the second is a workload scale the third is instructions for the final screen the final screen consists of 15 two choice questions. You only need [the exe file](https://github.com/Art3mi0/surg-tlx/blob/69651281e8417a7ab67c276b2317430cd55ecfa9/surg-tlx.exe) and place it in a folder where results are desired.
